# Code Examples by Andrew Sutherland

This repository contains selected code snippets, scripts, and mini-projects that showcase my work in experimental and applied physics. These examples demonstrate my hands-on experience with scientific computing, diagnostics, data acquisition, and analysis.

## üîç Overview

Each subfolder contains a self-contained example, typically with a brief description and any relevant dependencies. Topics include:

- **Diagnostics & Control**
  - Real-time data visualisation using Python and EPICS
  - Automated alignment and calibration routines
- **Data Analysis**
  - Signal processing for laser‚Äìplasma experiments
  - Curve fitting and uncertainty analysis
- **Simulation & Modelling**
  - Particle dynamics simulations (Python, MATLAB)
  - Optical system modelling and beam propagation
- **Miscellaneous**
  - Quick utilities and scripts used in lab environments
