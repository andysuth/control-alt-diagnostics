# Plasma Modelling ‚Äì Particle-in-Cell Simulations for PWFA

This repository contains simulation input files, scripts, and analysis tools for modelling plasma-based particle acceleration using the Particle-in-Cell (PIC) method. These models are developed for use with [VSim](https://www.txcorp.com/vsim) by Tech-X Corporation.

## üî¨ What is a Particle-in-Cell (PIC) Code?

PIC codes are a class of computational physics tools used to simulate plasma dynamics. They combine:
- **Lagrangian particles** (representing electrons, ions, etc.)
- **Eulerian electromagnetic fields** (solved on a spatial grid)

The particles are moved through the fields, while the fields are updated based on the particle currents and charge densities. This self-consistent loop allows accurate, time-resolved modelling of kinetic effects in plasma.

PIC codes are critical in plasma physics where analytical solutions are impossible, especially in highly non-linear and relativistic regimes.

## üöÄ Relevance to Plasma Wakefield Acceleration (PWFA)

Plasma Wakefield Acceleration is a technique where a high-energy particle beam (the **driver**) excites a strong wake in a plasma, which can accelerate a trailing beam (the **witness**) to very high energies over short distances.

PIC simulations allow researchers to:
- Resolve the femtosecond dynamics of beam-plasma interaction
- Optimise parameters like plasma density, beam profile, and injection timing
- Predict experimental observables with high fidelity
